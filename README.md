# Simple Linear Regression

### Objective:
Determine if there is a linear relationship between head size and brain weight in healthy human adults

### Summary:
Basic univariate linear regression to determine and evaluate the relationship between the volume of human head size (cc) and brain weight (g)

### Data:
The dataset we use provides information on 237 individuals who were subject to post-mortem examination at the Middlesex Hospital in London around the turn of the 20th century. Study authors used cadavers to see if a relationship between brain weight and other more easily measured physiological characteristics such as age, sex, and head size could be determined. The end goal was to develop a way to estimate a personâ€™s brain size while they were still alive.

### Methodology:
We implement Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method of linear regression in a Jupyter notebook and explore basic plots

### Statistical analysis:
- **Pearson's correlation coefficient (r)**: measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables
- **p-value**: determines whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis when compared with a predetermined significance values

### Next Steps:
- Search for more recent data
- Explore multiple linear regression
- Investigate other evaluation metrics
- Implement Machine Learning algorithm to improve model
